# FortunoffParadoxDump
Once upon a time, we used Paradox for our database of record. Now we don't, but sometimes we still need the data in Paradox to answer questions. Queries and structural organization of our Paradox SQL dump will live here. The dump itself lives locally.

## GeneralInfoForm1.sql
